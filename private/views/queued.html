 <h3>Plot enqueued</h3>
 Your SPLAT plot has been enqueued with id %%plot_id%%!<br/>
 It may take up to 20 minutes if the server is busy before your plot is rendered<br/>
 <br/>
 Please be patient as this uses a lot of resources to generate the plot (our elevation database is approx 10gb alone!)<br/>
